# Introduction

## Turing Model

what computer model can be described?

- a basic data processor
  - input data
  - computer
  - output data

basic data process can only handle specific computation, we need genneral model

- a general data processor (a programmable data processor)
  - input data
  - computer
  - a program, a set of instructions that tells computer what to do with data
  - output data

This is turing model. It can do same thing with modern computer, if it has same input and same program
